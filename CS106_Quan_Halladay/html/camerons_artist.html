                        Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter most famously known for such works as Bedroom in Arles (1888), The Starry Night (1889), and Wheatfield with Crows (1890). 
                        Post-impressionism is a French art movement that occurred between 1886 and 1905. These artists evoked emotion in their work rather than portraying realism. 
                        Such a style resulted in varied paintings between artists with unnatural color and symbolic motifs. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Born into a an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh was serious, quiet, and thoughtful. He worked as an art dealer but became depressed later in his life. 
                        He also suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions. He worried about his metal health but did not treat his body right. Heavy drinking and not eating properly took a toll on him. 
                        In a confrontation with Gauguin, Van Gogh lost part of his left his ear when in rage he cut it off with a razor. 
                        Finally, in 1890 depression got the better of him and Van Gogh shot himself in the chest fatality wounding himself. He died from his injuries two days later.

                    <p>                        
                        Regarded as one of the best painters to ever live, Van Gogh saw no success while he was alive. He was considered to be a madman and a failure. 
                        However, around the 20th century he began to gain popular success and would now be remembered as a tragic, but important painter. 
                        Van Goghâ€™s works are now among the most expensive pieces of art to ever be sold.
